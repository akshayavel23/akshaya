<img src="C:\jana\pixel.jpeg" width="1300" height="400">
<p>We have created a fictional "personal" website/blog, and our fictional character is a hobby photographer.Photography is an important tool for preserving memories and telling stories. Images let individuals relate to one another and also shed light on the past. Taking up photography is great because it forces you to document your experiences. </p>
<h1><center>BIOGRAPHY OF MY PHOTOGRAPHY</center></h1>
<p>I prefer to talk about myself in the first person, if you don't mind.Photography is my fashion,career,etc.i love to take a photos of natural scenaries.I create colorful, graphic images and GIFs that help brands tell their story. I like to create an aspirational version of reality that feels like a sunny day. I attended SF State University where I found a love for telling stories through pictures in the Photojournalism department. I love graphic design, interior design, and all things food. It is important that I pet as many dogs as possible.
